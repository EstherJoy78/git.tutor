#BMI CALCULATOR.

In this project, we are going to write a python program to calculate the BMI

Measurements:

1. Weight(Kgs)
2. Height(m)

BMI = Weight/(Height*Height)

We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is overweight, Normal or underweight.

Thank you.

#We have created a branch called new features

Results:

if BMI > 25 then the person is overweight.

if BMI is between 18 and 25 , then the person is normal.

if BMI > 18 then the person is underweight.
